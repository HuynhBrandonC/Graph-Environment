      You can add nodes with the add node button and give the nodes a name
      acting as an id. You can drag the nodes around to rearrange them and add
      edges between two nodes. You can view the current graph as an adjaceny
      list or an adjaceny matrix. I have two algorithms of searching as of right
      now. Depth first and Breadth first search.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      How depth first search works is given a starting node and a target node,
      it goes down a connected edge. It keeps going down that connected edge
      until it either reaches the target or it can no longer go down an edge. In
      that case it backtracks nodes on the path it just went down until it
      reaches a node that has an available edge to go down. And then it goes
      through the same process until the target node is found, or no node is
      found.
