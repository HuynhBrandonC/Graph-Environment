      You can add nodes with the add node button and give the nodes a name
      acting as an id. You can drag the nodes around to rearrange them and add
      edges between two nodes. You can view the current graph as an adjaceny
      list or an adjaceny matrix. I have two algorithms of searching as of right
      now. Depth first and Breadth first search. You can step backwards and
      forwards through these functions step by step to see how they work.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      How depth first search works is given a starting node, it goes down the
      path as far as it can, visiting each node on the way. If it reaches as
      deep as it can, it backtracks to the previous node and checks if any of
      its neighbors haven't been visited. And, it repeats the process until all
      nodes are checked or the target node is found. If no target found is given
      it will show the distance between the starting node and each node
    </h3>
    <h3>
      How breadth first search works is given a starting node it will visit each
      neighbor of that node before it advances in which it will then first visit
      all neighbors of each of the nodes it visited, and on until it reaches the
      target node or visits all nodes. This will also show the distance between
      each node if no target node is given
